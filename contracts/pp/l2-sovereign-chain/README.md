All the files and directories within this directory have been generated using the import-contracts command of the CLI in this repo.
The ABI and the binnaries of the smart contracts have been extracted from [agglayer-contracts repo](https://github.com/temaniarpit27/agglayer-contracts.git), using the version arpit/testing (commit ead6e44cdf97afee7320f67ffbbdb47ecb02f0b7)

The CLI command used to generate the contracts: `$ go run ./cmd import-contracts --contracts-version arpit/testing --contracts-alias l2-sovereign-chain-2 --proving-schema pp --node-version 18`
