# aggchain-multisig contracts

All the files and directories within this directory have been generated using the import-contracts command of the CLI in this repo.
The ABI and the binnaries of the smart contracts have been extracted from [agglayer-contracts repo](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer-contracts.git), using the version v12.1.0-rc.3 (commit e2a68464f2f34a759731089ed26d2769fce1c2d3)

The CLI command used to generate the contracts: `$ go run ./cmd import-contracts -cv v12.1.0-rc.3 -alias aggchain-multisig -node 22`
