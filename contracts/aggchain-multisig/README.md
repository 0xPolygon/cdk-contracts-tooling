# aggchain-multisig-new contracts

All the files and directories within this directory have been generated using the import-contracts command of the CLI in this repo.
The ABI and the binnaries of the smart contracts have been extracted from [agglayer-contracts repo](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer-contracts.git), using the version v12.2.0 (commit f27cc65f4b2ed5dcd4342c6d8f903738ac439418)

The CLI command used to generate the contracts: `$ go run ./cmd import-contracts -cv v12.2.0 -alias aggchain-multisig -node 22`
