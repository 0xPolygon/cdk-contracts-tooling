# pessimistic-proofs contracts

All the files and directories within this directory have been generated using the import-contracts command of the CLI in this repo.
The ABI and the binnaries of the smart contracts have been extracted from [zkevm-contracts repo](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts), using the version v9.0.0-rc.3-pp (commit c8659e6282340de7bdb8fdbf7924a9bd2996bc98)

The CLI command used to generate the contracts: `$ go run ./cmd import-c --cv v9.0.0-rc.3-pp --alias pessimistic-proofs --node 20`
